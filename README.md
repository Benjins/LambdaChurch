The Church of Lambda
====================
Hi, welcome to the Church of Lambda.  Here, we believe that the function is sacred.  And nothing else is.

*Nothing.*

To that end, we've created a system with some rules.  All computation must be done using only anonymous functions, and simple bindings^*.

^*With some conversion functions between lambda encodings and native Racket types, for testing purposes.
